# Exploratory Data Analysis

it may seem like the stats guru is on point with their analysis upon first glance 
when using the same assumption and removing the rows with occupancy rates lower than
10%, the green buildings still average $2.6 dollars more per square foot. 

While looking at the box plot we see that the non-green buildings have a fair amount
more outliers, which explains the guru's reasoning for using the median as opposed 
to the mean

# Rent vs. Occupancy Rates
We can see that the minimum rent is fairly constant for all occupancy rates, but the
maximum increases with higher occupancy rates

Looking further into this we can note that the green buildings have a higher median occupancy 
rate, which could be attributed to the awarness mentioned in the information provided with
the problem, but the true cause can't be verified with the data provded

# Age vs. Occupancy Rates
From the plot there is no clear relationship between age and occupancy rate 

#POSSIBLE UNEXPECTED FACTORS
Factors that may inderectly influence the rent for buildings

# 1. Number of stories
From the plot, we can see that the minimum rent charged increases with the number of 
stories, but the median height of a green building is only one story taller than a 
non-green building, which likely isn't a large enough difference. So while a taller
building may be able to demand more rent, this likely isn't a strong enough factor to 
influence the decision to go green. 

# 2. Amenities
When loooking at the possility of amenities being a factor in raising rent, we see that
most green buildings have amenities (~73%), where about only half non-green buildings 
have them (~52%). When comparting rent for green and non-green buildings with and withput
amenities, we see that green buildings still charge $2 to $2.8 more per square foot irreguarless
of amenities, meaning this isn't a factor in the differnce in rent.


# 3. Age
We can see that the median green building is about 15 years newer than the median non-green
building, thus we should consider that maybe newer buildings demand a higher rent by default
and that this upcharge isn't necessarily due to the fact the building is green.

Looking at the plot of rent vs building age, there is hard to see a clear correlation
in the data, with maybe a slight downward trend after the building has reached 100 years
old, but there isn't enough data on green buildings at that age to manke any conclusions0.

# 4. Space 
When looking at the plot of rent vs square footage, we can see that the minimum rent 
charged increases with available leasing space. 

Then, when we look a the median and mean square footage for green and non-green buildings
we see that green building have a greater value for each, so they have more space to
lease in general, which could be a potential unexpected factor in the rent upcharge.

# 5. Clustering (Building location)
Could location influence the rent price for buildings? Could we use location to maximize 
profits for our new building?

Looking at a plot of rent vs cluster, we can notice a distinct trend in clusters 300 to
around 600. When looking at the median value for these clusters seperating by if the 
building is green or not, we can see that the green buildings charge ~$4.8 more per square
foot in the same cluster, meaning in these areas the perception of a green building is potenitally
more positive and people are willing to pay more to be viewed as environmentally consious.

# Summary and Conclusions 
There is a slight positive relationship between rent and occupancy rates. 
Green buildings have a slightly higher rate of occupancy.

No clear corrolation between building age and occupancy rate

There is an additional $2.6 per square foot in revenue for green buildings, and this 
difference increases to ~$4.8 for clusters 300 - 600.

Rent and available square footage have a small positive corrolation.
Green buildings are, on average, ~ 100,000 square feet larger than non-green buildings,
but more data is needed to further explore this idea.

The guru seems to be correct, with the average age of green buildings being 22 years, we should
expect to make our money back within 10 years then make additional revenue from then on.
